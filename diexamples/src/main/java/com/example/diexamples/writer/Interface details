Till Java 7 -
Interfaces - allowed only
                - public static final (Constant) variables
                - public abstract methods
                - U cannot instantiate the interfaces directly
In Java 8 - onwards
          - allowed
            - public static final (Constant) variables
            - public abstract methods
            - default methods - with definition
            - Static methods - with definition
In Java 9 - onwards
          - allowed
            - public static final (Constant) variables
            - public abstract methods
            - default methods - with definition
            - Static methods - with definition
            - private methods
            - private static methods
Advantages of these private methods:
        - Code re-usability:
            If two default methods need to share code,
            a private interface method allows them to do so without exposing
            that method to implementing classes.
        - Confidential code:
            Private methods are visible only within the interface itself,
            making them suitable for confidential or internal logic.

            These private methods are accessible only within the interface itself and cannot
            be inherited by other interfaces or classes.
Uses of Interfaces:
    - To achieve
        -1 Multiple Inheritance
            While classes allows only single inheritance, however interfaces allows u to implement
            multiple interfaces to single class.
        -2 To add some behavioural functionality ex- Comparable, Comparator and Clonable
        -3 To achieve Polymorphism
        -4 Default Methods in Interfaces- to achieve backward compatibility,
            sometime,, In a Well established application, u will get requirement which needs writing single function in an interface would solve the purpose, so Java 8 onwards introduced the default methods which will not break flow by addind default methd,
            where as adding abstract method will affect all the flow who implement that interface.
