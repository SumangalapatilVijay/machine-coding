Till Java 7 -
Interfaces - allowed only
                - public static final (Constant) variables
                - public abstract methods
                - U cannot instantiate the interfaces directly

            - private static methods
<h1>Advantages of these private methods:</h1>
    <h2> Code re-usability:</h2>
        If two default methods need to share code,
        a private interface method allows them to do so without exposing
        that method to implementing classes.
    <h2> Confidential code: </h2>
        Private methods are visible only within the interface itself,
        making them suitable for confidential or internal logic.

    <h2> These private methods are accessible only within the interface itself and cannot be inherited by other interfaces or classes.</h2>
